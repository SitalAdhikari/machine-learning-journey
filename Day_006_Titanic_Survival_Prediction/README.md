# 📅 Day 6 – Titanic Survival Prediction (Without Pipelines)

Today I worked on building a machine learning model for **Titanic Survival Prediction** without using pipelines to better understand the manual workflow.

## 📌 What I Did

* Loaded and explored the dataset
* Handled missing values
* Applied encoding to categorical features
* Scaled numerical features
* Trained a machine learning model
* Evaluated model performance

## 🎯 Result

The model gave **100% accuracy (1.0)**.

This is highly suspicious and unrealistic for this dataset, which likely indicates:

* Data leakage
* Incorrect train-test split
* Target leakage
* Some preprocessing mistake

## ⚠️ Next Step

I will carefully debug the notebook and identify why the model is achieving perfect accuracy.

Understanding mistakes is part of learning.
