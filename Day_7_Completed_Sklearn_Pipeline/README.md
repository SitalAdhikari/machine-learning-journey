# 📅 Day 8 – Improving ML Workflow with Sklearn Pipeline

Today I continued working on the Titanic Survival Prediction project and refined the complete machine learning workflow using **Sklearn Pipeline**.

This session focused on making the workflow cleaner, more reliable, and aligned with real-world ML practices.

## 📌 What I Worked On

* Finalizing preprocessing steps
* Proper integration of ColumnTransformer inside Pipeline
* Ensuring no data leakage
* Cleaner model training and evaluation workflow
* Improving code structure and readability

## 🧠 Key Learning

Building models is not just about training algorithms.
A proper ML workflow must:

* Avoid data leakage
* Keep preprocessing structured
* Be reproducible
* Be scalable for production
