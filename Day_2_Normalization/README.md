# Day 2 – Normalization in Machine Learning

Today I learned about **Normalization (Min-Max Scaling)**.

Normalization rescales data to a fixed range, usually between 0 and 1.

Formula:
X_new = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min)

Why it is important:
- Keeps all features within the same range
- Improves performance of distance-based algorithms
- Helps models train more efficiently

In this notebook, I:
- Applied manual normalization
- Compared values before and after scaling
- Visualized the results
