Day 5 – Column Transformer in Machine Learning

Today I learned about Column Transformer, which allows applying different preprocessing techniques to different columns in a dataset within a single pipeline.

✅ What I Learned

Why preprocessing should be column-specific

Combining:

One Hot Encoding (categorical data)

Standardization (numerical data)

Using sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer

Cleaner and scalable preprocessing workflow
