# Day 3 – Ordinal Encoding in Machine Learning

Today I learned about **Ordinal Encoding** in Machine Learning.

Ordinal Encoding is used to convert categorical data into numerical values when the categories have a meaningful order.

Example:
Low → 0  
Medium → 1  
High → 2  

Why it matters:

• Machine learning models cannot work with text data directly  
• Preserves the natural order of categories  
• Useful for ranked or ordered features  

In this notebook, I:
- Converted categorical features into numerical form  
- Applied ordinal encoding step by step  
- Observed how ordered categories are represented numerically
