# 📅 Day 9 – Function Transformer in Machine Learning

Today I learned about **Function Transformer** in scikit-learn and how it allows us to apply custom transformations inside a machine learning pipeline.

##  What I Learned

* What `FunctionTransformer` is
* Why custom transformations are needed
* Applying mathematical transformations (like log transformation)
* Integrating FunctionTransformer inside a Pipeline
* Making preprocessing more flexible and modular

## Why It’s Important

In real-world datasets, we often need custom feature transformations such as:

* Log transformation for skewed data
* Custom feature engineering
* Mathematical operations on specific columns
