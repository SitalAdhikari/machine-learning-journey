# 📅 Day 4 – One Hot Encoding

Today I learned and implemented **One Hot Encoding**, a technique used to convert categorical variables into numerical format for machine learning models.

## ✅ What I Covered

* Why encoding is needed
* Difference between Label, Ordinal, and One Hot Encoding
* Implementation using `pandas` and `sklearn`
* Avoiding dummy variable trap

## 📂 File

* `4_One_Hot_Encoding.ipynb`

## ⚠️ Note

There is a small issue in the final part of the notebook. I tried to solve it but couldn't complete it today.

I will continue debugging and fix it on **Day 5**.

🚀 Consistency > Perfection
